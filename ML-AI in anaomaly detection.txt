### Project: Anomaly Detection in Windows Event Logs Using Machine Learning

#### **Project Overview**
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect anomalies in Windows Event Logs, which could indicate system compromise, malicious activities, or unusual behavior.

---

### **1. Data Collection**
   - **Source Logs**:
     - Use Windows Event Viewer to export logs.
     - Relevant log categories include:
       - Security (e.g., logon events, privilege escalation).
       - System (e.g., service failures).
       - Application (e.g., application crashes).
   - **Sample Datasets**:
     - Utilize publicly available datasets like:
       - [Mimicus: Anomaly Detection Benchmark Dataset](https://github.com/juand-r/mimicus).
       - Windows Event Logs in repositories on GitHub.
       - Simulated attack data from tools like Metasploit or Atomic Red Team.

---

### **2. Preprocessing the Data**
   - Parse `.evtx` files using the `python-evtx` library.
   - Extract key fields:
     - **EventID**: Numeric identifier for events (e.g., `4624` for logon).
     - **Timestamp**: Event occurrence time.
     - **Source**: Origin of the event (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`).
     - **Description**: Free-text details about the event.
   - Normalize timestamps and encode categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding for `EventID`).

---

### **3. Feature Engineering**
   - Aggregate event counts by:
     - User.
     - Source.
     - EventID.
   - Compute derived features:
     - Time between events.
     - Frequency of specific EventIDs (e.g., repeated logon failures).
   - NLP processing for event descriptions (e.g., TF-IDF vectors).

---

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualize:
     - Distribution of EventIDs.
     - Time-series trends for specific users or processes.
   - Correlation between EventIDs and known attacks (e.g., brute-force).

---

### **5. Model Development**
#### **Unsupervised Learning Approach (Anomaly Detection)**
   - **Isolation Forest**:
     - Detect events that deviate significantly from normal patterns.
   - **Autoencoders**:
     - Train on normal event data; anomalies result in higher reconstruction errors.
   - **DBSCAN**:
     - Cluster normal events and identify outliers as potential anomalies.

#### **Supervised Learning Approach (Attack Classification)**
   - **Prepare Labeled Data**:
     - Label known attacks or anomalies in logs.
   - **Train Models**:
     - Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost).
   - **Evaluation Metrics**:
     - Precision, Recall, F1-Score (focus on minimizing false negatives).

---

### **6. Implementation Example**

#### **Python Code for Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load preprocessed log data
data = pd.read_csv('event_logs.csv')  # Ensure this contains numeric features

# Feature selection
features = data[['EventID', 'Source', 'Frequency', 'TimeGap']]

# Train Isolation Forest
iso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
data['Anomaly'] = iso_forest.fit_predict(features)

# Visualize results
anomalies = data[data['Anomaly'] == -1]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data.index, data['Frequency'], label='Normal', color='blue')
plt.scatter(anomalies.index, anomalies['Frequency'], label='Anomalies', color='red')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Anomaly Detection in Windows Event Logs')
plt.show()

# Save anomalies
anomalies.to_csv('anomalies.csv', index=False)
```

---

### **7. Deployment**
   - **Real-Time Analysis**:
     - Stream logs using `Wevtutil` and process with Kafka or RabbitMQ.
   - **Visualization**:
     - Use dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Kibana) to display anomalies.
   - **Alerting**:
     - Integrate with email/SMS notifications for detected anomalies.

---

### **8. Evaluation**
   - Compare results with baseline models or known labeled anomalies.
   - Validate the model using simulated attacks (e.g., brute-force, privilege escalation).

---

### **9. Extensions**
   - Add contextual threat intelligence to correlate anomalies with known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
   - Apply NLP to event descriptions to classify logs based on textual patterns.
